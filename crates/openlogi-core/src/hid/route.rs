//! How to reach a controllable HID++ device — addressing data only, no I/O.
//!
//! Two addressing modes:
//!
//! - [`DeviceRoute::Bolt`] — a device paired to a Logi Bolt receiver, reached
//!   through the receiver channel at a pairing slot.
//! - [`DeviceRoute::Direct`] — a device attached straight to the host over a
//!   USB cable or Bluetooth, reached on its own channel at the HID++
//!   self-index [`DIRECT_DEVICE_INDEX`].
//!
//! Opening the channel a route names is `openlogi_hid::channel::route::open_route_channel`
//! — the one place both the write path and the capture session resolve a
//! route to an open channel, so the Bolt-vs-direct branch lives in exactly
//! one place.
