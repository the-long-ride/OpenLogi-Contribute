//! arming — changes, and dispatches each captured input against the binding

//!
//! - a gesture swipe through the gesture binding map,
//! - a DPI/ModeShift or thumb-wheel-tap press through the button binding map,

//!   [`ThumbwheelScrollDown`](openlogi_core::binding::ButtonId::ThumbwheelScrollDown)
