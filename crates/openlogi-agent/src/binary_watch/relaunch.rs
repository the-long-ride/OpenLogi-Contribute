//! How a restart is actually carried out, per OS.
//!
//! [`super`] decides *that* the agent should become the binary now on disk;
//! this module knows what that costs on each platform, and the three answers
//! have nothing in common:
//!
//! - **Linux and the other unixes** `exec` the new image in place, which keeps
//!   the pid, the singleton lock, and the IPC socket.
//! - **macOS** cannot: after `exec` the new program continues on the calling
//!   thread, while AppKit insists the status item be created from the process
//!   main thread. So it schedules a detached successor and exits, and the
//!   successor waits for this process to release the singleton lock. Going
//!   through LaunchServices (`open`) rather than spawning the binary directly
//!   is what preserves the helper's TCC identity — see
//!   `.claude/rules/objc-ffi.md` and the permissions skill.
//! - **Windows** has no `exec` at all: it exits and lets the GUI's socket-down
//!   spawn (or the next login) start the replacement.
//!
//! The macOS path also serves the Input Monitoring grant, which needs the same
//! "leave and come back" move for an unrelated reason.
