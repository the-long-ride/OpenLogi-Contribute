//! Supervision of the warm Actions Ring overlay helper.
//!
//! The helper owns no device state and exits harmlessly when its binary is not
//! packaged. Keeping it warm removes process-start latency from panel presses.
//!
//! Exactly one overlay may exist, and it belongs to one agent run. Both halves
//! are enforced by the `succession` crate: this supervisor waits while the role
//! is filled by its own child, and evicts a tenant left behind by a previous
//! agent — which is what stops an orphaned overlay from wedging its
//! replacement out of the lock forever (#621, #644). The run token travels to
//! the child in the environment, so a helper started by a previous agent is
//! recognizable on sight rather than after a timeout.
