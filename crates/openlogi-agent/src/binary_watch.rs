//! Restart the agent when its on-disk executable is replaced — and stop it when
//! that executable goes away for good.
//!
//! An app update (Homebrew cask, the in-app updater, a dev rebuild) swaps the
//! bundle on disk while the old agent keeps running. launchd only restarts the
//! process when it *exits*, so nothing would pick up the new binary until the
//! next login — and a GUI launched from the new bundle refuses the old agent's
//! IPC protocol on a version bump, sitting on its connecting screen with no way
//! forward. Watching our own executable and replacing the process image once it
//! changes keeps "the running agent is the installed binary" true within a few
//! ticks, with no launchd or GUI involvement. How a restart is actually carried
//! out differs per OS and lives in [`relaunch`].
//!
//! The same stat answers the uninstall question. Dragging the app to the Trash
//! does not stop the agent: it keeps running from the trashed bundle with its
//! macOS event tap armed, which is the worst possible moment to hold one — the
//! user is about to revoke the permissions it depends on (#674, #807). Absence
//! is ambiguous for one tick (every replace unlinks before it writes), so it
//! only means "uninstalled" once it has held for [`MISSING_TICKS_UNTIL_GONE`]
//! ticks, and then the agent shuts down through its normal path, which drops
//! the hook and detaches the tap.
//!
//! Limitation: the path is resolved once via `current_exe`, which returns the
//! fully-resolved target (`/proc/self/exe` on Linux). Installs that update by
//! flipping a symlink to a new immutable payload (Nix profiles) never change
//! the resolved file, so this watcher can't see those updates; every shipped
//! channel replaces the binary in place.
