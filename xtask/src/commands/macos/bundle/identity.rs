//! The macOS identity a bundle carries: `CFBundleIdentifier` plus the name
//! macOS lists it under.
//!
//! macOS keys TCC grants (Accessibility, Input Monitoring) to a bundle's code
//! identity, and `openlogi_core::paths` keys the config profile to that
//! identifier's suffix. A shipped bundle wearing the dev identity therefore
//! voids every existing permission grant *and* reads a different config
//! directory — which is what releases 0.6.24–0.6.26 did, because the identity
//! was a side effect of which command happened to produce the bundle.
//!
//! So it is never inferred: [`stamp`] writes the chosen [`Channel`]'s identity
//! over every component, and [`verify`] reads it back before anything signs,
//! packages or notarizes the result.
